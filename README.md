## NuttX Tool
nxtool aims to unify the heap of scrips gathered under nuttx/tools that serves as helpers for building nuttx os. 
It draws inspiration from tools such as [west](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/west) and [newt](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-newt). 
It's end goal is to provide an meta-tool to interact with the actual build system used and the requirements it actually draws but in a more stream lined approach.
